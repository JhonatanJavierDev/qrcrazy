# QrCrazy

This project is a simple system that allows you to generate QR codes via an API by sending plain text, which can be a URL, code, or any desired content. The system returns the corresponding QR code. It is extremely straightforward and easy to understand, created as part of a larger project. The intention behind it is to provide a simple tool that can be integrated into a website to generate QR codes through this API.
